module CE.Protocol.Version (majorMatches, proto) where

-- | Protocol version spoken by this server (single source together
-- with cli/src/corelink.rs::PROTO — contracts/VERSIONING.md §1).
-- 6.3.0 = the foreign reader role (plan v2.18 step #12, user ruling
-- 2026-08-28: a declared submodule is a READER of the tree, never a
-- MEASURED part of it). graph/1 node rows may carry role bit 7: the
-- node -- file, package or section -- belongs to a declared
-- submodule; roleBits lands it on the same entry bit as the test
-- convention (its references seed reachability, it is never judged),
-- and the Rust side marks it from the index's own `files.owner`
-- fact, measures none of its other roles, and keeps it out of every
-- verdict universe (score, join, structure, clone pairs, docdup, the
-- advisory domain). A tree without submodules sends no bit 7 and is
-- judged byte for byte as before (K16).
-- The per-version change ledger lives in contracts/VERSIONING.md and
-- nowhere else. It used to be mirrored here in English and a third
-- time in cli/src/corelink.rs; the three copies drifted (four entries
-- sat in one English mirror and not the other) and a mirror that
-- gains an entry every minor grows without bound inside a size-gated
-- file. What stays here is THIS version's entry and nothing
-- else, because a reader standing at the constant needs to know what
-- today's number means -- what every past number meant is a ledger
-- question, and the ledger has an address. Four entries had stacked
-- up here by 6.1.0 and pushed the file past its own ratchet: the
-- ledger that documents a size gate is not exempt from it.
