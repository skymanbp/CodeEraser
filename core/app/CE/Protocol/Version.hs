-- | Protocol version spoken by this server (single source together
-- with cli/src/corelink.rs::PROTO — contracts/VERSIONING.md §1).
-- 7.9.0 = seven more report documents in `document/1` (plan v2.32
-- step 4; design booklet docs/reference/authority-track.md §5),
-- additive: a `document.request` may now name check, structure,
-- join, deadcode, mentions, sites or graphscreen beside step 3's
-- five, and the definition package's `document` catalogue lists
-- their schema ids and empty documents (sites with its kind names),
-- so `tablesDigest` moves. Every judgment family answers byte for
-- byte as before; the capability list is unchanged.
-- The per-version
-- ledger lives in contracts/VERSIONING.md and nowhere else; only
-- THIS version's entry stays beside the constant. The reason the
-- mirrors were retired is written once, at the client's constant
-- (cli/src/corelink.rs::PROTO) -- it is not repeated here.
